# huffman
Java program to encode and decode a character-based file using a canonical Huffman code.

A final project for an Algorithms course which I created a encode/decode character-based file using a canonical Huffman code.

Usage:

To encode:

java huffman.Encode 'source' 'target'

To decode

java huffman.Decode 'source' 'target'
